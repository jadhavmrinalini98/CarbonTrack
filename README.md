🌍 Carbon Tax & Economic Growth Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the impact of carbon taxes on CO₂ emissions and GDP in countries where economic growth is heavily dependent on carbon-intensive industries. The study investigates whether introducing carbon taxes can lead to a reduction in emissions while maintaining sustainable economic growth.
